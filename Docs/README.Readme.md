In software development, a README file contains information about the other files in a directory or archive of computer software. 
A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called README, Read Me, READ.ME, README.TXT, **README.md** (to indicate the use of Markdown), or README.1ST.
The file's name is generally written in uppercase. On Unix-like systems in particular, this causes it to stand out � both because lowercase filenames are more common,
and because the ls command commonly sorts and displays files in ASCII-code order, in which uppercase filenames will appear first.

There are several reasons why a **README** file is typically written in plain text or markdown format (**README.md**) rather than a Word document (**.docx**):

1. *Compatibility*: Plain text and Markdown files can be read on any system with any text editor. Word documents require specific software to open and read, which may not be available on all systems.

2. *Version Control*: Plain text and Markdown files work well with version control systems like Git. Changes can be easily tracked line by line. Word documents are binary files, and changes in these files are not easily diffable in version control systems.

3. *Simplicity*: **README** files often don't need the complex formatting options that Word provides. Markdown provides enough formatting options (like headers, links, lists, code blocks) for a **README** file.

4. *Visibility*: On platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, **README.md** files are automatically rendered and displayed on the main page of the repository. This is not the case with Word documents.

5. *Portability*: Plain text and Markdown files are lightweight and easy to share or distribute, while Word documents are typically larger and can be cumbersome to distribute.

So, while you technically could use a Word document for your **README**, it's generally not recommended due to these reasons.
