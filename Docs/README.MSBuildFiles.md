<a name="MSBuildFiles"/>[**MSBuild Files**]()
MSBuild Files: These are the files that drive the build process. They include [.props](#props) and [.targets](#targtes) files, which define properties, items, and targets used by the build process. These files are typically located in the CurrentVersion.targets and CurrentVersion.props files in the SDK.
