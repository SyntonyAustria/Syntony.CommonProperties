Git is a distributed version control system. It allows developers to track changes to their code over time, and enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes.

Git is a command-line tool that is installed and run on a developer's local machine. It does not provide a user interface or hosting for repositories.

Git is open-source and can be used with any type of project, regardless of the programming languages or tools used.
