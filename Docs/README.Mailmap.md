<a name="mailmap"/>[**.mailmap**](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap)

A **.mailmap** file is used in a Git repository to handle inconsistencies in commit author names and email addresses. It's a mechanism to map each author's various names and email addresses to a single, canonical representation.
The **.mailmap**  file is typically placed in the root directory of a Git repository.
