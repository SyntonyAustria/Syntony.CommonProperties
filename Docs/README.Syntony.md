<a name="Syntony"/>**Syntony**

Why we are named **Syntony**?
The word "**Syntony**" has two main meanings:

1. In electronics: **Syntony** is the state of being adjusted to a certain wavelength or frequency. This is important for radio receivers and other devices that need to tune in to specific signals. When a receiver is in a syntonic state, it is able to pick up the signal with <u>maximum clarity</u> and strength.

2. In more general usage: **Syntony** can also refer to a <u>**state of harmony**</u> or resonance between different things. This could be between two people, two ideas, two companies, or two parts of a system. 
 
When things are in **Syntony**, they work together smoothly and effectively.
So we are in a syntonic state with <u>**YOU**</u>.
