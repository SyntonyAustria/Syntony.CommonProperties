<a name="gitignore"/>[**.gitignore**](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

The **.gitignore** file is used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected.
The purpose of this file is to ensure that certain files and directories are untracked by Git. 
This is typically because these files are generated from source files that are already tracked, are personal to developers and not needed by others, or are temporary files that don't need to be shared.
