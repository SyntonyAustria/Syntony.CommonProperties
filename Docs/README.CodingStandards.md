# Introduction 

Anybody can write code. With a few months of programming experience, you can write 'working applications'. Making it work is easy, but doing it the right way requires more work, than just making it work.

Believe it, majority of the programmers write 'working code', but not 'good code'. Writing 'good code' is an art and you must learn and practice it.

Everyone may have different definitions for the term 'good code'. In my definition, the following are the characteristics of good code.

- Reliable
- Maintainable
- Efficient

Most of the developers are inclined towards writing code for higher performance, compromising reliability and maintainability. But considering the long term ROI (Return On Investment), efficiency and performance comes below reliability and maintainability. If your code is not reliable and maintainable, you (and your company) will be spending lot of time to identify issues, trying to understand code etc throughout the life of your application.

# Purpose of coding standards and best practices

To develop reliable and maintainable applications, you must follow coding standards and best practices.

The naming conventions, coding standards and best practices described in this document are compiled from our own experience and by referring to various Microsoft and non Microsoft guidelines.

There are several standards exists in the programming industry. None of them are wrong or bad and you may follow any of them. What is more important is, selecting one standard approach and ensuring that everyone is following it.
